## My Findings
- Really nice layout, thanks Dani

Multiply `2` integers

- Using just the required param `?exploit=` doesn't change anything
    - Adding 'you've been hacked' to the end allows it to be printed to the on screen console

        Things to note from this:
        - In the url `spaces` are changed to `%20` and `'`s (single quotes) to `%27`,
        - and `'`s are added to output

- Using `{{ }}` (an empty expression call) as the option for the param, just clears the output console. Also, if we pass in `{{hello}}`, we get an empty output

- Whereas, if we pass in `{{2}}`, we get `2` as the output, from this I think we can do multiplication expression.

- By doing `{{2*2}}` and we get `4` as the output,

    Similarly we can do `{{3*8}}` and get `24` as the output.

-- This completes the first task of multiplying 2 integers.

Multiply an `int` & a `str`

First searching if its possible to multiply a strign by an int, I found [this site](https://www.pythoncentral.io/use-python-multiply-strings/) & [this site](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#list-of-control-structures), which states that you can do

`2 * 'string'` and get `stringstring` as an output. So it is possible.


- Seeing that `{{2*2}}` worked, we will try `{{2*'hello'}}`,

    However, as the output we get: `Not a valid Jinja2 expression.`

- Sense that didn't work we will try without `'`s (single quotes) around hello as `{{2*hello}}`, for this output we get an error page,

    `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'hello' is undefined`

    This means that the server is expecting hello to be a variable and can't find to defined anywhere in the code/browser..

    - Setting `hello` as a variable in either the render_template call or the code above it doesn't seem to affect or benifit this exploit as the server still believes it to be impossible.
